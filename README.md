We utilized the MediaPipe library along with OpenCV to create a real-time hand gesture recognition system using a webcam. MediaPipe provided us with pre-trained hand landmark models, allowing us to detect and track hand landmarks accurately. OpenCV facilitated webcam access and image processing tasks such as converting color spaces and drawing on frames. By combining these tools, we were able to build a robust hand gesture recognition application capable of detecting and visualizing hand landmarks in real-time video streams.
